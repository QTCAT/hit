# Hierarchical Interference Testing (HIT)

Satus of CI for Unix:
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/QTCAT/hit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/QTCAT/hit), and for Windows:
[![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/QTCAT/hit?branch=master)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/QTCAT/hit) 

The package can be installed from an R console via `devtools`. If `devtools` is not yet installed you have to do so.

     # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("QTCAT/hit")
    
The functionality of the package is represented by the example of the `hit`-function (please be aware, that this can take a few seconds).
